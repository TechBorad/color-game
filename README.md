# Project1-Color-Game
This is a simple web app-repo made entirely from HTML,CSS and JS.
"Color Game" as the name suggests is a fun little game based on color guessing made entirely with HTML,CSS and JS.
There are two modes in the game: "Easy" and "Hard", with 3 and 6 tiles respectively. Out of those tiles you need to guess the
right color by its rgb value. It's a fun game and at the same time helps you be a better color picker.
